CURRENT BUGS / issues :

1) Video currently does not read the serial # in setup.txt

2) When run in a virtual machine, Zbar will sometimes spontaneously crash

3) Agora's binary is 64 bit, requiring us to use a 64 bit linux, but 
  Raspi video driviers are only available in 32-bit
  Thus, we need the hybrid Arduino / Linux solution vs a compact one

4) Receivercallback will wait until it finishes each task before opening the next message 

5) Will compile on archlinux fine, but will not compile on *Buntu
